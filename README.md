## Where's the back-end?
I have the back-end on its own repo, [chek it out here.](https://github.com/dmo575/portfolio-backend)

# About

Front-end for my portfolio website, which you can find HERE(TBD).

It uses Vitejs, React and Bootstrap for the front-end and Deno (with Typescript) for the back-end.
