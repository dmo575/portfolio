I got introduced to programming while doing my BFA in Game Development (focus on design) in the form of C# scripts for the Unity3D engine.

I liked it so much that I continuously asked the programming department to let me in in more traditional programming classes (which I suceeded at).

After graduating I started working at a game company as a Loc Tester with the initial idea of grinding my way up the design team but instead of that, I started to study programming on my own again after work.

I did that for over half a year before deciding that I wanted to pursute this path full time.
