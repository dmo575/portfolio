# Introduction
My first ever full website. It was my final project for CS50x. I didn't knew a lot of the things I know now and the code shows it but nevertheless the website has a bunch of really cool features like:

    - Seen (SAW): The movie has been watched by the user
    - Favorite (FAV): The movie is a favorite for the user
    - Pending (PEN): The movie is in the "to watch" list
