My final project for [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/).

- **$$$Chatroom**: all users have access to a global live chatroom where they can participate (socketIO)
- Registering and logging in/out (username and password, no email required)
- Restricted access to the webpage unless logged in
- Hability to search movies and series (trough the imdb API)
- Instant search results as you type (AJAX)
- Keep track of movies per user **and** collection in an efficient way (no movie duplicates in the db)
- User can assign movies to various collections and filter then out later
- Placeholder images while fetching from the API
- Did both back-end and front-end
