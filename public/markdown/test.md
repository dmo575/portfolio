*This is some italic text*

**And this is some bold text**

Here I am writing and an image follows below:

<img src="./../../public/images/js.svg" className="w-25 rounded-5" alt="Some image" width="15%"/>

And this is the line right after it.


# Big sentence

Small sentence with `some inline code` right there

```
function(args) {
    console.log("test");
}
```
