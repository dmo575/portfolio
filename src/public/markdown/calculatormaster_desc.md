Addictive calculator mini-game made in plain JS/CSS/HTML.

- **$$$Global leader-board** that displays username, score and country flag.
- Interacts with several APIs:
    - **ipinfo.io** (*server-side*) : for info on the client's **direct** IP. 
    - **flagsapi.com** (*client-side*) : for fetching country flags based on a country code.
    - **API** on the server to update and retrieve leader-board data.
- Adaptive design, works on both PC and mobile screens (portrait and landscape).
- Heavely animated windows, making interactions engaging.
- Makes heavy use of ES6 promises and other JS asynchronous functions.
- I manage **$$$a database** for the leader-board with SQLite.
